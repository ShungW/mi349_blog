            <h2>Building my Saturn60 Keyboard</h2>
            <p>My build-log of my Saturn60 keyboard</p>
            <time datetime="2021-10-14">October 14<sup>th</sup>, 2021</time>
                <h3>Getting the Keyboard</h3>
                <p>I received the Saturn60 keyboard kit after about a year from ordering.
                    It took longer than normal to ship due to COVID delays and PCB fabrication errors.
                    There was an ortholinear option, and a staggered (normal). I opted for the staggered option.</p>
                <p><img src="unboxed.png" alt= "Saturn60 keyboard unboxed"></p>
                <h3>Building the Keyboard</h3>
                   <p>My Saturn60 was built with Novelkey Silk Switches (a recoloring of JWK Linears) and Durock
                    screw-in stabilizers. The switches were lubricated with Krytox 205g0 and the springs were 
                    bag lubed with GPL-106 oil. The stabilizers were holee-modded and then lubed with krytox 205g0.
                     The keyset I initially used was GMK Noel, but I ended up switching it out with MT3 BoW (Black on White)
                    The build was alright, and it was my first keyboard which used gaskets as the main mounting
                    mechanism. It was much heavier than I thought it would be (around 6lbs). The only issue I had
                    was relating to the positioning of the plate. I had to gently force the plate into position after
                the keyboard was mostly built in order to put the keycaps on properly.</p>

                <h3>Finishing Up</h3>
                    <p><img src="badge.png" alt= "Lining up the Saturn60 adhesive badge"></p>
                    <p>In the end, I had to put on the adhesive badge to finish the keyboard, I used masking tape
                        to make sure that the badge wasn't crooked in any way, as the adhesive is nigh impossible to remove
                        after its initial application.</p>
                <h3>Final Result</h3>
                    <p>I'm just really a big fan of the design of this board, I don't really have much else to say. It's one of my favorites. It's 
                        definitely one of the more unique looking ones in comparison to the myriad of others I've seen in various keyboard communities.</p>

            <h2>Making Cables</h2>
            <p>A little rundown on some of the cables I've made in the past</p>
            <time datetime="2021-10-13">October 13<sup>th</sup>, 2021</time>
                <h3>My first braided cable</h3>
                <p>Looking back on it, it was mostly a disaster. The whole process took me around 5 to 6 hours
                    and I ended up putting on less paracord than I needed, so I had to use extra heatshrink to hide
                    the mistake, which didn't help the look of the cable. It was a fun project, however. I would 
                    definitely choose less bold colors next time.</p>
                <h4>Stripping the Sleeving</h4>
                <p>The first step to making a coiled cable was actually stripping the rubber sleeving, copper shielding, and paper to get to the 
                    individual wires that you must then sleeve with your paracord of choice. (I used Paracord 250 and Mogami 2564 wire).</p>
                    <p><img src="strip.png" alt="Picture of Mogami 2564 rubber jacket being removed"></p>
                    <p><img src="stripped.png" alt="Picture of Mogami cable fully stripped from its insulation and shielding"></p>
                <h4>Sleeving and Braiding</h4>
                <p>sleeving is one of the most time consuming parts of making cables, but the final result is almost always worth the effort.
                    I had decided to go with purple and green for this (my favorite colors). I unfortunately didn't account for the fact that this
                    color choice would mean that it would fit with almost none of my headphones without looking extremely out of place.</p>
                    <p><img src="sleeved.png" alt="Picture of Mogami cable sleeved with purple and green paracord"></p>
                    <p><img src="braiding.png" alt="Picture of sleeved cable taped to desk for braiding individual wires"></p>
                <h4>Final Result</h4>
                    <p>I <em>obviously</em> had to hide the heatshrink job when taking the final picture, so it looks better here than it does if you scrutinize
                        it. Overall, it was a learning experience and I will definitely tackle the process differently next time I make one.</p>

                <h3>A coiled keyboard cable for a friend</h3>
                <p>My friend asked me to make him a cable for his keyboard. He was going for a certain theme and wanted
                    something to match it, so I obliged.</p>
                    <p><img src="cable1.jpg" alt="Picture of pink and green coiled keyboard cables"></p>
                <p>He wanted pink and green as the main colors, and asked if I could make it swappable between
                    micro-usb and usb-c, in case he gets a keyboard with micro-usb. It was a fairly simple process,
                    besides the coiling (multiple runs with a heat gun).</p>
                    <p><img src="cable2.png" alt="Picture pink and green sleeved wire"></p>
                <p>Overall, I think the final result was pretty good. The electrical tape marred the green a bit, but I managed
                    to remove the residual adhesive with tape. I'm personally not a big fan of the 
                    color scheme. I wasn't making the cable for myself, however, and my friend was stoked to receive it.</p>
                <h3>A few short RCA runs for my amp and DAC</h3>
                <p>I recently got a new DAC and amp in the mail, and after 3D printing some mounts to keep them out of the way,
                    I made some short RCA runs to avoid extra cable clutter under my desk.</p>
                    <p><img src="leftrca.png" alt= "Picture of left-channel audio RCA cable"></p>
                    <p><img src="rightrca.png" alt= "Picture of right-channel audio RCA cable"></p>
                <P>Personally, I think they turned out really well.</P>
