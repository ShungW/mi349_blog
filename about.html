    <p>Hi, my name is Shungloon Wong, but I just go by Shung. I am currently studying Information Science
        at MSU, and I hope to be graduating by next year. Most of my hobbies are indoors, besides cycling,
        which I do recreationally or on my commute to campus. </p>
        <p>My other hobbies are mostly indoors, which include items like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mechanical Keyboards</li>
            <li>Headphones/Audio</li>
            <li>Records (I just like the experience)</li>
            <li>3-D printing/Modeling</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I consider myself to be rather adept at soldering, I like making cables for headphones or other 
            peripherals, and I enjoy coming up with different color combinations for them. 
            I have also dabbled in modeling and 3-D printing keyboard cases, though in comparison to others in
            the hobby, I have barely touched the surface.</p>
